# Game Development Portfolio (Dominik Strzałko)

Hi, my name is Dominik aka. Kokon, and this is my project portfolio. I work mainly in **Unity** and **Godot**, but I'm not scared of UE4, RenPy, or even Roblox Studio. I'm a fast learner, and I even have some background in Data Science/AI.

To see my CV, send me a mail at dominikstrzalko@gmail.com

I've divided this portfolio into 4 main categories:
- Work related projets (3 Parts)
- Science related projects
- GameJams related projects
- Everything else

Legend for symbols:
- :construction_worker: - Solo work
- :dancers: - Team project
- :pencil2: - Some/All graphics in the game made by me
- :game_die: - Game Design
- :computer: - Programming
- :necktie: - Team Management
- :poultry_leg: - Rigging and Bone Animations

# 1. Work Related Projects, Part 1. [Knoocker/Knowla ( :dancers: Team, :construction_worker: Solo, :computer: Code, :pencil2: Art, :game_die: Design, :poultry_leg: Rig/Anim)](https://knowla.eu/en/)
Projects that I've finished in my current job. I've programed and designed almost all of them, from start to finish. This is how Knoocker works, where single developer works with a graphic designer, and have to create final product from the idea, to relesed game. Every game is created for our own hardware: Knowla Box and Knowla Wall.

# 2. Science Related Projects

## 1. [Visual Simulation ( :eyes: Computer Vision, :dancers: Team, :computer: Code)](https://github.com/SnowyCocoon/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/Computer%20Vision/1.%20Visual%20Simulation)
**Description:** It's a combination of two things that I love: Unity and AI. The first step in this project was creating a few scenes in the unity engine, that represent forests in different configurations (like day and night), with different trees, and then creating thousands of screenshots, of those scenes. The second step was to create a neural network (Multilayer Perceptron and CNN), that can recognize the type of tree on the image. Our team managed to receive the highest accuracy on our test set, and we also created the most realistic scenes.  

**Tech stack:** Unity Engine, C#, Python, Tensorflow/Keras, OpenCV, Pandas

## 2. [My Masters Thesis and an Article - Voice Controlled Games ( :speech_balloon: NLP, :construction_worker: Team, :computer: Code)](https://annals-csis.org/proceedings/2021/pliks/143.pdf)
**Description:** because I graduated with a master's degree in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence, I wrote my master's thesis about controlling games with a voice in both the Unity engine and Godot engine. before finishing up my master's degree, I also participated in the FedCSIS science conference as a speaker, where I presented my results in the same field. I was able to win the **Best Paper Award** in the Young Researcher Workshop category.  

**Tech stack:** Unity, Godot, C#, Microsoft Azure, Alphacephei Vosk, Windows Speech Recognition API in Unity, LUIS

## 3. [Foodie Finds Love ( :dancers: Team, :computer: Code, :necktie: Management)](https://adriannowak97.itch.io/foodie-finds-love)
Is it possible to create a game without any writing and artistic skills, or even basic knowledge about the engine, in which you will create a game? That is what we wanted to check with Adrian Nowak and Jan Kaszycki, and that's why we created an almost entirely AI-based game: "Foodie Finds Love".

**My duties:** Managing the team, Programming, Creating all artworks with stable diffusion, creating all dialogues and plot (mostly with ChatGPT)

**Tech stack:** RenPy, ChatGPT 4, Stable Diffusion, Eleven Labs, SonicPi, Bark, Python
