# Game Development Portfolio (Dominik Strzałko)

Hi, my name is Dominik aka. Kokon, and this is my project portfolio. 

I've divided it to 4 main categories:
- Work related projets (3 Parts)
- Science related projects
- GameJams related projects
- Everything else

# 1. Work Related Projects, Part 1. Knoocker/Knowla
Projects that I've finished in my current job. I've programed and designed almost all of them, from start to finish. This is how Knoocker works, where single developer work with a graphic designer to create final product from the idea, to relesed game.

## 1. Room Sorter
## 2. English Alphabet
## 3. Jumper (Normal and English version)
## 4. Jellyfish
## 5. Labirynth
## 6. Letter Search
## 7. Space Travel
## 8. Shape Selection
## 9. Twister
## 10. Catcher
## 11. Ziuu
## 12. PI
## 13. Voice Controlled games demos

# 1. Work Related Projects, Part 2. Poznan University of Economics And Business - VR Lab
**Description:** My first gamedev related job/internship. I've worked on a project for "Enea Operator" a Polish power industry company. Our team created a VR simulation, where technicians from the ENEA, could train their skills.
**My duties:** 3D modeling and optimizing models for VR, Programming fixes, Testing the VR Software, Helping managing the semantic web database in excel.
**Tech Stack:** Unity, 3DS Max, Microsoft Excel, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive

# 1. Work Related Projects, Part 3, Microtaur
**Description:** Together with my dear friends Krzysztof Tomala and Wojciech Sosnowski, we've created our own self called studio: Microtaur. We created a few games together, and we've created a few MVP-s for different companies like: Kinguin or JaRock. Right now we're creating another MVP for a new client conected to streaming industry.
**Tech Stack:** Godot, GDScript, Roblox, Blender, Aseprite, Unity, C#

# 2. Science Related Projects

## 1. [Visual Simulation (CV :eyes:)](https://github.com/SnowyCocoon/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/Computer%20Vision/1.%20Visual%20Simulation)
**Description:** It's a combination of two things that I love: Unity and AI. The first step in this project was creating a few scenes in the unity engine, that represent forests in different configurations (like day and night), with different trees, and then creating thousands of screenshots, of those scenes. The second step was to create a neural network (Multilayer Perceptron and CNN), that can recognize the type of tree on the image. Our team managed to receive the highest accuracy on our test set, and we also created the most realistic scenes.  
**Tech stack:** Unity Engine, C#, Python, Tensorflow/Keras, OpenCV, Pandas

## 2. [My Masters Thesis and an Article - Voice Controlled Games (NLP :speech_balloon:/Gamedev :video_game:)](https://annals-csis.org/proceedings/2021/pliks/143.pdf)
**Description:** because I graduated with a master's degree in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence, I wrote my master's thesis about controlling games with a voice in both the Unity engine and Godot engine. before finishing up my master's degree, I also participated in the FedCSIS science conference as a speaker, where I presented my results in the same field. I was able to win the **Best Paper Award** in the Young Researcher Workshop category.  
**Tech stack:** Unity, Godot, C#, Microsoft Azure, Alphacephei Vosk, Windows Speech Recognition API in Unity, LUIS

## 3. [Foodie Finds Love (Gamedev :video_game:)](https://adriannowak97.itch.io/foodie-finds-love)
Is it possible to create a game without any writing and artistic skills, or even basic knowledge about the engine, in which you will create a game? That is what we wanted to check with Adrian Nowak and Jan Kaszycki, and that's why we created an almost entirely AI-based game: "Foodie Finds Love".
**My duties:** Managing the team, Programming, Creating all artworks with stable diffusion, creating all dialogues and plot (mostly with ChatGPT)
**Tech stack:** RenPy, ChatGPT 4, Stable Diffusion, Eleven Labs, SonicPi, Bark, Python
